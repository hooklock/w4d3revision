# Music Library - Sinatra App

Last week we created a Music app with albums and artists. Create a Sinatra app on top of the existing code we created. There should be:

- Create RESTful routes for album and/or artist

## Extensions

These are extension revision topics and do not need to be completed:

- A 'library' route a user can go to that:
	- Lists all the artists and their albums
	- Add more data to your tables e.g. images
  - Create some wicked CSS
